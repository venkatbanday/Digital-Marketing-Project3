# Digital-Marketing-Project3
Building Content Marketing Plan
Any product launch is incomplete without a definite content development strategy or a plan on how the customers are going to be reached out.
A good communication strategy provides us with a strong selling proposition that will attract the customers' attention to the product and help instill confidence and trust. Hence, a well-thought out content communication strategy will ensure that the right message has been sent to the customer regarding the product, which will then translate into sale/revenue.
In the previous project, you created buyer personas to whom your product will appeal the most. The next step is to reach out to the selected persona using a concise and strong communication strategy.
This project will help you to:
•	Create a content marketing plan
•	Draft a social media crisis plan
•	Develop a brand advocacy plan
Prerequisite
Learners attempting this project are required to go through section 5 (Building Sales Engagement Through Content Marketing) of the course before they start working on the solutions.
Project Goals/Objectives
•	Create a content marketing plan targeting your buyer personas
•	Define the measurable success metrics that tell you whether your plan is on track or not
Project Task
Task I: Develop a social media crisis plan
•	Draft a high level social media plan of action which your team would follow in the event of a PR crisis. List out other stakeholders/teams that would need to be made aware of the action plan.
•	Explain in detail:
o Would you enable comments on your Facebook wall?
o Would you disable the ability to comment right after the crisis goes public?
•	Draft an official statement in response to the crisis, and specify which channel(s) you would post it on and why?
•	It's important to make your customers feel involved, especially in times of crisis. What incentive would you offer your audience in exchange for suggestions on how to handle the crisis?
•	Listening to and monitoring the social media landscape are key components of a social media crisis plan. List the types of conversations/keywords you would be looking for.
Task II: Optimize your content calendar
•	You had planned to publish a series of blog posts about your product for the upcoming month. However, since the recent crisis you want to redefine your messaging to emphasize your product's quality and help reaffirm your brand's equity. How would you optimize your content calendar to adapt to your new branding needs?
•	It's important that you get your newly branded content to a wide audience; therefore, you decide to set up a multi-channel campaign. What content types would you create, and what channels would you use to reach your audience?
o Facebook
o LinkedIn
o Twitter
o YouTube
The PR crisis has been defused, and it's back to business as usual. It's important that you recognize those individuals who are loyal to your brand (advocates), so you decide to create a brand advocacy scheme:
•	List metrics that you would use to identify your brand advocates.
•	Craft a message including an incentive you would send to the brand's most engaged customers.
